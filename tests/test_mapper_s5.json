Each qubit has an id (its index, used as gate operand and in the resource descriptions) in the range of 0 to hardware_settings.qubit_number-1. Qubits are connected by directed pairs, called edges. Each edge has an id (its index, also used in the resource descriptions) in some contiguous range starting from 0, a source qubit and a destination qubit. Two grid forms are supported: the xy form and the irregular form.
